BlueJ project text-adventure

based on "zork1" by Michael Kolling, Monash University

-------------
This project is a simple framework for an adventure game. In this version,
it has a few rooms and the ability for a player to walk between these rooms.
That's all.

This project was written as the starting point of a small Java project.

The goal is to extend the game:

  - add items to rooms (items may have weight)
  - add multiple players
  - add commands (pick, drop, examine, read, ...)
  - (anything you can think of, really...)

To start this application, create an instance of class "Game" and call its
"play" method.

From there, I created a game that had a user navigate rooms with time limitations,
find tools, and use them in an attempt to escape. I made this in December 2016.
