/* * Class Room - a room in an adventure game. * * Author:  Michael Kolling/Aronson * Version: 1.1 * Date:    August 2000 *  * This class is part of Zork. Zork is a simple, text based adventure game. * * "Room" represents one location in the scenery of the game.  It is  * connected to at most four other rooms via exits.  The exits are labelled * north, east, south, west.  For each direction, the room stores a reference * to the neighbouring room, or null if there is no exit in that direction. */class Room {    private String description;    private Room north, south, east, west;    String newItem;    String roomRoomItems = "";    /**     * Create a room described "description".
